## Project Poblem statement

A logistics and supply chain company wants to make a dashboard for OTIF Analysis. 
On-time in-full (OTIF) is a supply chain metric for measuring performance in the logistics industry. OTIF generally refers to a supplierâ€™s ability to deliver product within prescribed delivery windows and at full quantities ordered.
OTIF was designed to improve store operations within Walmart itself and quickly led to a series of major changes as it was quickly adopted by other retailers and companies.
So they have given data which considers 4 sheets. They are Orders, Salesperson, Customer and City. 
Expectations of Stakeholders are:-
1)	Make various KPIs.
2)	Explain the OTIF Performance over Time
3)	What is the Order delivery status over Time?
4)	What are the Highest OTIF Performances?
5)	Do something with Key Influencers and other advanced visualizations.
